Opening your eyes, you come to realize you no longer reside on the plane of complacency. In front of you levitates the same priest-queen you saw engraved on the massive wooden doors at the entrance. Her eyes are purple and cashew-shaped, glaring benevolently at you. You do not know how but you command your body to rise to her level and approach her. A swell of incense, infused into her body, washes over you. You can see her hands, ornately decorated with filigrees of purple and gold, reaching up to cradle your face. You close your eyes, submitting to her draw. You now breathe, see, and walk on the plane of veneration. You have this feeling deep down in your gut that assures the world of your godliness. Turning around, you address a monumental crowd of Ccaizhdi peoples, jaws bellowing and weapons thumping against shields. You utter your name - 'Ccaizhdi-zai'!
