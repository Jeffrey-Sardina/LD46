{"text": "You wonder what that last word you just chose means. You got over the bridge at least, you happily think to yourself. The ceiling of the hallway opens up to a banquet room. Except that there are no tables, but rather rows up above, like at a coliseum, where they watch gladiators die.\n\nOnce you fully take in your surroundings, the number of things to do overwhelm you. The monotony of the journey thus far has dulled you. Here, there is a burnt door at the top of the stairs, a barrel at the bottom, a tunnel to even further down below, and a majestic gilded door.\n\nYou walk up to the gilded door and you quickly figure out the symbols directly on the center - they say, 'VAB XAE', followed by the word from the final tile you stepped upon, as if the name were yours. You notice a table with a golden chalice next to it. You also notice of a strange trap-like podium in the center of the room. The ceiling is immensely high, glinting from above.\n\n", "next_file": "fourthpuzzle", "health_change": 0}
