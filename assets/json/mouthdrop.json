{"text": "You arrive at an intersection of a sturdy branch and a massive, cavernous hole in the trunk. Your mouth drops as you realize the magnitude of this hole. It can easily fit an entire inn inside! Through two sets of steps leading downstairs, you see a landing with a regal carved door at the bottom.\n\nYou hold the wall as you step down the right side of the stairs, leading down to this majestic hall. You step into the center of the landing to take full sight of the door. \n                \nThe door, although made of the same stout material as the tree, looked steely. Depictions of weapons - spears, morningstars, and daggers enameled the door. Figures who held them had broad noses and jutting jaws, with canines exposed. Those figures held up their bodies and weapons proudly, leading the way up to the center of the door, where a veiled figure lay transcended above all. Rays shone from her. \n\n", "next_file": "wordsondoor"}
