        'subj-see ACTOR that ... VSO'
            ex "Fáth'guu      etho'dhithim koth fánil thá"
                SEE      the  sea-fairies  that drown he / she
                literally: May the sea-fairies see that (s)he drown

Spelling rules
    Use and apostaphe to separate a root from the ACTOR prefix, or from the verb tense marker
        These markers always come first on a word
    Other prefixes simply attach to the word, and they attach before the apostrophe-ed prefixes
