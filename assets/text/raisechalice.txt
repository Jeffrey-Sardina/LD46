raisechalice.txt - You encapsulate the chalice with your filthy hands and raise it. You peer in it and it is magically filling with wine! Wine! You eagerly want to show it to someone, but see a gate in the distance creakily raising. You see a set of horns you've seen in literature... Those hooves... Those hands... Comes out a monstrosity donning an ox's head, a man's body, and the legs of a bull. The minotaur exhales forcefully and courses towards you, his battle ax swinging. You, being a laughable puny halfling, faint unceremoniously under the unmerciful minotaur's gaze.  The tome is dashed to bits by the minotaur who then eats it as fodder. You lose.
