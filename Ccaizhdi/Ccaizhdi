Ccaizhdi is an interesting specimen, to say the least. It grew up in a multi-racial environment, and serves as a force for unities the races in a common culture. It is, oddly enough a object initial. So this is where I am going to ask you to take a step back stop thinking English-ly!. Because object-initial messes with stuff, big time. Fun fact, Klingon was the first language known to the linguistic research community that had an object-initial structure. It was made so as a joke, people thinking nothing of the kind could every exist. Well, object-initial languages do exist, but rarely (less than 1% of all know languages).

The Ccaizhdi peoples live a very 'do it' lifestyle centered around individual glory. Thus there is no 'I would x'; the express the same meaning through 'I will / do x'. Doubt and fear and looked down upon, as in uncertainty. The Ccaizhdi language hardly pauses for the small things, but rather focusses on 'just say it'. Or better yet, let your action speak and 'do it'.
